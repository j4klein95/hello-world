# hello-world
My first repository.

Hello to anyone reading this,

  This is my first time using GitHub! I am an international affairs graduate from the George Washington University. The reason why I want to learn to code and learn data analytics is because the intertwining interests between globalization (which is in part because of the internet and speedy communication) and international relations. Specifically for data analytics, I want to be able to create, access, and interpret data for companies involved in international development. Something like analyzing data on poverty rates in specific countries may help non-profits and other entities distribute resources properly in such countries. 
  
  
  I'm a little nervous...I hope I get into the boot camp.
